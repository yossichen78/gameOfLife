Unzip and open ticTacToe.html to play!

To play with more than two players - add the new sign to the players array in the .js file:

players = ["X","O","Z"]

To play a bigger board - change the rows variable.

I assumed we were playing relatively small boards, in which case the O(n^2) board checks are not slowing us down too much.
